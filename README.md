This is a set of basic data structures written in pure C.
Of course, there is already tons of C libraries, but this
code is written just for myself. If you want to use it -
you are welcome.

Currently, it includes such data structures:
1. Linked list.
2. List (aka vector in C++).
3. Hash map.
4. Heap.
